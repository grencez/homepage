\section{Shell}
The commands in my tutorials assume a POSIX-compliant shell.
So if your default shell is \ilname{tcsh}, then please type
\begin{code}
bash
\end{code}
before executing any commands.

\section{Variables}
I often use shell variables instead of dummy names in command examples so that someone can set those variables and then copy/paste the commands.
(It's not great practice to do this from untrusted sources on the internet, but there's your \textbf{disclaimer}.)
So, if my guide says to assume \ilcode{user=my_awesome_username}, and your username is ``leethaxor'', then you should run
\begin{code}
user=leethaxor
\end{code}
before running the commands after that.
Those commands will substitute orrences of \ilcode{$user} or \ilcode{${user}} with \ilcode{leethaxor}.
